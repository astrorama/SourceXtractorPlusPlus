        target : MeasurementImage object, or leaf MeasurementGroup object with a single image, or a list of either
            Target images on which to measure the aperture photometry. Leaf MeasurementGroup with a single image

            Diameter of the aperture. As different MeasurementImage may not be aligned, nor have equivalent pixel size,
            the aperture is interpreted as diameter in pixels of a circle on the detection image.

        list of Aperture objects
            An Aperture object is an internal representation of a property on the measurement frame that contains the
            apertures. To actually get the measurements on the output catalog, you need to add explicitly them to the
            output.

        Notes
        -----
        This property will generate five columns with the prefix specified by `add_output_column`:
        - ``_flux`` and ``_flux_err``, for the flux and its associated error
        - ``_mag`` and ``_mag_err``, for the magnitude and its associated error
        - ``_flags``, to mark, for instance, saturation, boundary conditions, etc.

        For M apertures and N images, the cells on the output column will be an array of MxN fluxes.
