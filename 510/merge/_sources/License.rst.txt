Discussion group for |SourceXtractor++| users
---------------------------------------------

In order to facilitaet an active disucssion among SourceXtractor++ users we have created
a `users group <https://groups.google.com/g/sourcextractor_plusplus>`_. We encourage all users to directly
join the group (if a google account is at hand) or to ask us to add you as member
(just open an issue on the `github page <https://astrorama.github.io/SourceXtractorPlusPlus/>`_).


References and Acknowledgment
-----------------------------

While we are working on several refereed papers describing |SourceXtractor++| and its software architecture, the software package can be referenced with two ADASS conference proceedings:

* `Bertin, E.; Schefer, M. ; Apostolakos, N. ; Álvarez-Ayllón, A.; Dubath, P. ; Kümmel, M.: 2020ASPC..527..461B <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ASPC..527..461B/abstract>`_
* `Kümmel, M. ; Bertin, E.; Schefer, M. ; Apostolakos, N. ; Álvarez-Ayllón, A.; Dubath, P.: 2020ASPC..527...29K <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ASPC..527...29K/abstract>`_

The ressources for the SourceXtractor++ development are mostly provided by funding from the `Euclid satellite project <https://www.euclid-ec.org/>`_ via
the various national agencies. For Euclid Consortium papers it is sufficient to point to the |SourceXtractor++|_ webpage and add the
standard EC acknowledgement text.

For scientific publication which are non EC papers we would be greatful if the following acknowledgment could be added:

  This research made use of {\tt SourceXtractor++}\footnote{https://github.com/astrorama/SourceXtractorPlusPlus}, 
  an open source software package developed for the Euclid satellite project.
