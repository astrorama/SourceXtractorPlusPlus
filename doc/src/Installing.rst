Installing the software
***********************

Hardware requirements
=====================

Terminal
--------

|SourceXtractor++| runs in (ANSI) text-mode from a shell.
A graphical environment is not necessary to operate the software.

Memory
------

Memory requirements depend mostly on the number of images to be analyzed.
A rule of thumb is that |SourceXtractor++| requires about 100MB of resident memory per input frame.
Extra-memory is taken advantage of through caching of pixel data.

CPUs
----

|SourceXtractor++|'s measurement pipeline is multithreaded and can take advantage of multiple CPU cores.
As of version 0.16, |SourceXtractor++| scales reasonably well up to 30 cores.

Obtaining |SourceXtractor++|
============================

.. only:: latex

  From Fedora or EPEL repositories |rawhide_release_png|
  ------------------------------------------------------

.. only:: not latex

  From Fedora or EPEL repositories |rawhide_release_svg|
  ------------------------------------------------------

|SourceXtractor++| is available in `Fedora <https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/sourcextractor++>`_
30 and greater, and in EPEL 7 as well. On those platforms, you can use your
package manager to install in the usual way:

.. code-block:: console

  # dnf install sourcextractor++

.. only:: latex

  From Anaconda Cloud |anaconda_release_png|
  ------------------------------------------

.. only:: not latex

  From Anaconda Cloud |anaconda_release_svg|
  ------------------------------------------

|SourceXtractor++| is also available for Linux and MacOS via Anaconda cloud.
You can install it as follows:

.. code-block:: console

  $ conda install -c conda-forge -c astrorama sourcextractor

Or you can, of course, add permanently the ``astrorama`` channel to your
conda configuration:

.. code-block:: console

  $ conda config --add channels conda-forge
  $ conda config --add channels astrorama
  $ conda install sourcextractor


It is recommended to install |SourceXtractor++| into its own
`environment <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html>`_
to avoid dependency conflicts.

.. only:: latex

  From Sources |github_release_png|
  ---------------------------------

.. only:: not latex

  From Sources |github_release_svg|
  ---------------------------------


The source package may be downloaded from the official `GitHub repository <https://github.com/astrorama/SourceXtractorPlusPlus>`_.
Links to binary packages for a selection of operating systems are also available at the URL above.

Software requirements
_____________________

|SourceXtractor++| relies on the |Elements|_ and |Alexandria|_ packages, which may be downloaded from `Astrorama  <https://github.com/astrorama>`_ repositories.
They are also available in Fedora and EPEL as ``elements`` and ``elements-alexandria``.

It also requires the following packages for installation:

* `Boost <https://www.boost.org/>`_
* `CCFITS <https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/CCfits/>`_
* `CFITSIO <https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/>`_
* `FFTW3 <http://www.fftw.org/>`_
* `Log4cpp <http://log4cpp.sf.net/>`_
* `OpenCV <https://opencv.org/>`_
* `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ (Python3.x recommended)
* `Python-AstroPy <https://www.astropy.org/>`_
* `WCSlib <https://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/mcalabre/WCS/index.html>`_

The following packages are optional:

* |GSL|_ (model fitting engine)
* |LevMar|_ (model fitting engine)
* `Readline <https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html>`_
* `Ncurses <https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/>`_ (progress bar display)
* `ONNXRunTime <https://onnxruntime.ai/>`_ (AI-based features)

All or most of these packages are available in the main Linux distributions.
You will also need the development version (``-devel`` or ``-dev``) of the packages if you compile |SourceXtractor++| from the source, plus the following packages:

* `GMock <https://github.com/google/googletest>`__
* `GTest <https://github.com/google/googletest>`_
* `Pytest <https://pytest.org>`_

If you have installed Elements and Alexandria from your distribution repository (right now, only in Fedora), you can skip the following section.

.. code-block:: console

  # dnf install elements-devel elements-alexandria-devel


Installing Elements and Alexandria
__________________________________

Elements is a C++ and CMake framework. It is capable of managing the dependencies
of projects based on CMake as long as it knows where to find them.
By convention, this location usually is ``~/Work/Projects``, but you can choose
any other.

.. code-block:: console

  $ export CMAKE_PROJECT_PATH=~/Work/Projects
  $ export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$CMAKE_PROJECT_PATH/Elements/cmake
  $ mkdir -p $CMAKE_PROJECT_PATH

Since Python 2 has been deprecated since the 1st of January 2020, it is recommended to tell Elements and other projects to use Python 3 instead.
You can also disable the build of documentation with ``-DUSE_SPHINX=OFF``.

.. code-block:: console

  $ export CMAKEFLAGS="-DPYTHON_EXPLICIT_VERSION=3 -DUSE_SPHINX=OFF"

You can always add for convenience these environment variables to your
``.bashrc``, or the one corresponding to your shell.


Elements can handle multiple versions of a given project, or with just one.
For the later, it suffices to clone the project into ``$CMAKE_PROJECT_PATH``.

.. code-block:: console

  $ cd $CMAKE_PROJECT_PATH
  $ git clone https://github.com/astrorama/Elements.git --branch 5.10
  $ cd Elements
  $ make install -j # -j uses multiple cores

Similarly for Alexandria:

.. code-block:: console

  $ cd $CMAKE_PROJECT_PATH
  $ git clone https://github.com/astrorama/Alexandria.git --branch 2.15
  $ cd Alexandria
  $ make install -j

Installation
____________

If you have compiled and installed Elements and Alexandria as described on the above section, make sure you are using the proper environment.

.. code-block:: console

  $ export CMAKE_PROJECT_PATH=~/Work/Projects
  $ export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$CMAKE_PROJECT_PATH/Elements/cmake

For system-wide installs, this step is not necessary.

Configure the project flags if you have not yet done it:

.. code-block:: console

  $ export CMAKEFLAGS="-DPYTHON_EXPLICIT_VERSION=3 -DUSE_SPHINX=OFF"

As a reminder, that tells |SourceXtractor++| to compile with Python 3, and not
to build the documentation.
|SourceXtractor++| can be built with Python 2, but this is strongly discouraged.

The sources can be obtained either from the `releases <https://github.com/astrorama/SourceXtractorPlusPlus/releases/latest>`_ as a compressed archive, or cloned with ``git`` the usual way.

If you download an archived version, you need to uncompress it:

.. code-block:: console

  $ unzip SourceXtractorPlusPlus-<version>.zip

A new directory called :file:`SourceXtractorPlusPlus-<version>` should now appear
at the current location on your disk.

If you opt for cloning the repository, make sure you are pointing to the latest commit in the ``master`` branch.

.. code-block:: console

  $ git pull

Either way, enter the directory you have just created, and build the software.

.. code-block:: console

  $ cd SourceXtractorPlusPlus
  $ make -j4

After the binaries are now compiled and available, |SourceXtractor++| can be run with:

.. code-block:: console

  $ ~/Work/Projects/SourceXtractorPlusPlus/build/run sextractor++ --help
