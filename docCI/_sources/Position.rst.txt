Isophotal measurements
======================

Position and shape
------------------

The following quantities are derived from the spatial distribution :math:`\cal S` of pixels detected above the detection threshold (see :ref:`description <isophotal_measurements>`).

.. important::
  Unless otherwise noted, the pixel values used for computing "isophotal" positions and shapes are taken from the filtered, background-subtracted detection image.
