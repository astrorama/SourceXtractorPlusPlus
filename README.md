# Installation

## Conda

SourceXtractor++ is available on [Anaconda Cloud for Linux and MacOSX](https://anaconda.org/astrorama/sourcextractor)

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge -c astrorama sourcextractor==0.19.2
 ```

We would recommend, however, to install it into its own environment.

```bash
conda create -n sourcex -c astrorama -c conda-forge sourcextractor==0.19.2
conda activate sourcex
 ```

**Note:** If you want the development version to test a future functionality or bugfix, it can also be done with conda:

```bash
conda create -n sourcex-dev -c astrorama/label/develop -c astrorama -c conda-forge sourcextractor=x.xx
conda activate sourcex-dev
```

We recommend always using an explicit version number as there is no guarantee that `conda` will install the latest version otherwise.

## Fedora

SourceXtractor++ is shipped directly in Fedora. It can be installed simply as follows:

```bash
sudo dnf install sourcextractor++
```

[We also build our own RPMs as part of our CI setup](http://repository.astro.unige.ch/euclid/devel/)
They can be installed adding a `.repo` file under `/etc/yum.repos.d` with the following content:

```ini
# Stable and tagged versions
# This is the recommended way to install sourcextractor++
[Astrorama]
name=Astrorama
baseurl=http://repository.astro.unige.ch/euclid/fedora/$releasever/$basearch
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0

# Enable this to get the stable (untagged) version
[Astrorama-Stable]
name=Astrorama Stable
baseurl=http://repository.astro.unige.ch/euclid/devel/stable/fedora/$releasever/$basearch
enabled=0
gpgcheck=0

# Enable this to get the development version
# Use with care!
[Astrorama-Develop]
name=Astrorama Develop
baseurl=http://repository.astro.unige.ch/euclid/devel/develop/fedora/$releasever/$basearch
enabled=0
gpgcheck=0
```

And install with

```bash
dnf install SourceXtractorPlusPlus
```

## Test Data Set

A test data set covering various data reduction scenarios is available [here](https://cloud.physik.lmu.de/index.php/s/3K4KemBsw5y9yqd).
It contains the input data, all relevant configuration files, the SourceXtractor++ commands and the expected output results for a reference.
The test data set is described as a [pre-print](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02428) for the corresponding conference proceedings.

## Discussion group for SourceXtractor++ users

In order to facilitate an active discussion among SourceXtractor++ users we have created
a [users group](https://groups.google.com/g/sourcextractor_plusplus). We encourage all users to directly
join the group (if a google account is at hand) or to ask us to add you as a member
(open an issue on the [github page](https://astrorama.github.io/SourceXtractorPlusPlus/).


## References and Acknowledgment

While we are working on several refereed papers describing SourceXtractor++ and its software architecture, the software package can be referenced with two ADASS conference proceedings:

- [Bertin, E.; Schefer, M. ; Apostolakos, N. ; Álvarez-Ayllón, A.; Dubath, P. ; Kümmel, M.: 2020ASPC..527..461B](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ASPC..527..461B/abstract)
- [Kümmel, M. ; Bertin, E.; Schefer, M. ; Apostolakos, N. ; Álvarez-Ayllón, A.; Dubath, P.: 2020ASPC..527...29K](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ASPC..527...29K/abstract) 

Resources for the SourceXtractor++ development are in most part provided by funding from the [Euclid satellite project](https://www.euclid-ec.org/) via the various national agencies.
For Euclid Consortium papers it is sufficient to point to the [SourceXtractor++ webpage](https://github.com/astrorama/SourceXtractorPlusPlus) and add
the standard EC acknowledgement text.

For scientific publication which are non EC papers we would be greatful if the following acknowledgment could be added:
```
This research made use of {\tt SourceXtractor++}\footnote{https://github.com/astrorama/SourceXtractorPlusPlus},
an open source software package developed for the Euclid satellite project.
```
