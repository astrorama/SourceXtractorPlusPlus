To add a new property :

Overview of the steps:

1) Create a property class that inherits from Property
2) Create a task class to compute the property
3) Create a factory class for that task. It will be used to create and provide the task class.
4) Optional: create one or more configuration class to provide the configuration to the factory class.

== Property class

The property class the container for the property's data. It should be immutable and provide access to the data with
as little overhead as possible.

class MyProperty : Property {
...
}

== Task class

This is where the computation is done. It should be constructed with everything it needs that does not come from
a source's properties.

== TaskFactory
The TaskFactory is responsible for providing a Task that will compute a given property.It should use the Configuration
system to get all the things required by the Task constructor
