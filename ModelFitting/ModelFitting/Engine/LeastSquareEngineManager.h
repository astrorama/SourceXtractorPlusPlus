 * Keep a registry of supported engines, and bridge their factory methods

 * Engines can register themselves at compilation time using StaticEngine. In this manner,
 * the final binary can have an arbitrary number of supported engines depending on the available
 * dependencies when compiling.
 *
 * Different engines may have different parametrization, so it is up to the respective
 * factory methods to initialize them. The only parameter passed down to the factories is
 * the maximum number of iterations.
